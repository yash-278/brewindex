## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 coarse phases; data pipeline first, discovery layer last
- Stack: Next.js App Router + Neon Postgres + Drizzle + Upstash Redis + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4
- Icons: Fetch from homepage domain favicon at sync time → Vercel Blob (no hotlinking)
- ISR: revalidateTag('casks') post-sync, not time-based TTL; top-500 pre-rendered via generateStaticParams
- Security: CRON_SECRET on sync endpoint; SSRF allowlist on all server-side fetches

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 5 added: Railway migration — move Vercel functions and Postgres to Railway hobby tier, monorepo strategy

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Icon sourcing reliability: DuckDuckGo favicon service is not an officially documented production API — validate coverage rate in Phase 2 and keep CSS initials fallback ready from day one
- generateStaticParams cutoff: Start at top-500 by install count; validate actual Vercel build time in Phase 2 and adjust if needed
